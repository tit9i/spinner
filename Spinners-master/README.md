# Spinners
SPINNERS is a collection of HTML and CSS Spinners, which are animations that show the user that some content is being loaded.

You can see it live here: [SPINNERS](https://boguz.github.io/Spinners)

## How to use it
To use any of the SPINNERS animations you just need to __copy and paste__ it's HTML and CSS codes.

The easiest way to do it is by using the [website](https://boguz.github.io/Spinners), but you can also do it directly here on GitHub.

For more information please read the [Full Instructions](https://github.com/boguz/Spinners/blob/master/instructions.md)


Or you can also install it via __Bower__, by writting on your console:

`$ bower install cssspinners`

## Who can use it
Everyone! I made SPINNERS to learn more about CSS animations, so i am happy to give it back to the community.

If you use it or if you like it, maybe you can just spread the word so more people can use it...   ;)
